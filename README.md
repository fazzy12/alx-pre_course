# ALX Pre Course
Welcome to the ALX Pre Course repository! This project is part of the pre-course work for the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to teach you how to use Git, a popular version control system used in software development.

By completing this project, you will learn the basics of Git, including creating a repository, committing changes, branching, merging, and collaborating with others. You will also learn how to write good README files, an essential part of any project.

Throughout this project, you will be working with the command line to perform various Git operations, so you will get hands-on experience with the tool. The project assumes no prior knowledge of Git, so anyone can follow along and learn.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this project will provide you with valuable skills that you can use in your future projects. So, let's get started and learn Git!


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is source code management
What is Git
What is GitHub
What is the difference between Git and GitHub
How to create a repository
What is a README
How to write good READMEs
How to commit
How to write helpful commit messages
How to push code
How to pull updates
How to create a branch
How to merge branches
How to work as collaborators on a project
Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo.

## Requirements
To complete this project, you will need to:

Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)
Create a personal access token on GitHub
Update your profile on the ALX Intranet with your GitHub username
Create a new repository called "alx-pre_course" on GitHub
Clone the repository to your local machine
Create a README.md file and add it to your repository
Add and commit changes to your repository
Push your changes to GitHub
Work with branches and merge changes
Collaborate with others on a project
Note that you should use the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You wonâ€™t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
